I am pursuing a Ph.D. at the [University of Delaware](www.udel.edu), specializing in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with a focus on data science. My research centers on enhancing the data generation experience from online social networks and evaluating advanced technology using Large Language Models (LLMs). Under the guidance of Dr. Matthew Maureillo at [Sensify Lab](https://sensifylab.cis.udel.edu/), I am currently involved in the SMIDGen project. Recent qualitative studies leverage vast amounts of online social network data to examine user-technology interactions. However, existing dataset generation methods are labor-intensive and challenging to reproduce. This project aims to develop an intuitive application to aid researchers in collecting, filtering, and interpreting data. The overarching goal is to investigate how such tools can enhance data quality and the reproducibility of insights."
