I am pursuing a Ph.D. at the [University of Delaware](www.udel.edu), specializing in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with expertise on data science. My research primarily focuses on enhancing the experience of data collection from online social networks and evaluating state-of-the-art technologies such as Large Language Models (LLMs) for use in insight generation. I am currently working under the guidance of Dr. Matthew Maureillo at [Sensify Lab](https://sensifylab.cis.udel.edu/) in the SMIDGen project. This project aims to develop an intuitive application to aid researchers in collecting, filtering, and interpreting data. The overarching goal is to investigate how such tools can enhance data quality and the reproducibility of insights.
